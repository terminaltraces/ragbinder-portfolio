    "gameDescription": "Free to Play Cross-platform Battle Royale with up to 150 players. I personally was responsible for keeping the development environment in a working state day-to-day, maintaining a high overall development velocity for the premiere AAA live-service title. We kept players engaged and having a world of fun with our game because we were able to deliver great updates every month. I also ensure that we didn't take two steps forward and one step back when releasing the yearly title update by integrating carry-forward content, including QoL features and Microtransaction content."

Lead your team of anti-heroes to saving the world from the machinations of evil cultists! I developed CI infrastructure to speed the pace of development, and empowered our engineers to be confident their features were delivered at quality."
